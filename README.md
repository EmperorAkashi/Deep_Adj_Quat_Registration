# PointCloud Registration via Adjuagte Quaternion representation
Point Cloud registration on ModelNet40 and KITTI Odometry dataset.
Our method adopts the analytical solution of 3D-3D point matching via an adjugate matrix of quaternion to the Deep closest point and the Graph-based virtual correspondence architecture.
